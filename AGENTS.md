# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.
- Pipeline overview, commands, and the 30-field schema + fill status table: see `README.md`.
- Every field value everywhere in `data/trials/*.json` is a sourced-value object (`value`,
  `source_type`, `source_url`, `source_excerpt`, `extracted_by`, `reviewed_by`, `confidence`) —
  never a bare scalar. `source_type` is only ever `ctgov_api` or `needs_extraction`.
- The `needs_extraction` fields (clinical thresholds, endpoint hierarchy, visit schedule,
  rescue rules) are deliberately left `null`. Do not fill them by inference or general
  knowledge — that requires a real LLM-extraction pass over protocol/SAP/FDA-review text plus
  human QA, which is future work, not something to shortcut here.
- The trial list in `scripts/fetch_trials.py::TRIALS` (which NCT IDs belong to which drug) was
  curated by hand against the live API, not derived by a query filter — if a drug's pivotal
  program changes or a new trial needs adding, update that dict directly rather than
  re-deriving it from a single API query (comparator-arm trials from other drugs' programs can
  otherwise get miscategorized).

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
